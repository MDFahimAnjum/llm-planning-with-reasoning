# Log Directory

This directory is designated for storing output log files generated during experiment runs. Logs are saved in `.json` format. Each file typically corresponds to a single experiment execution.

The primary purpose of these logs is for:

*   **Analysis:** Evaluating experiment results, comparing different configurations, and understanding model behavior.
*   **Debugging:** Identifying the root cause of errors or unexpected outcomes.
*   **Reproducibility:** Providing a detailed record of how results were obtained.
